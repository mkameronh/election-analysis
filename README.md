# election-analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to help Seth and Tom complete an election audit for the election commission for a congressional election in Colorado. We were tasked with writing a script in VBA to do the followin:

1. Calculate the total number of votes
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate received.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
6. Calculate the voter turnout for each county
7. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
8. The county with the highest turnout


## Election-Audit Results
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast
- The county votes and percentage of total votes:
    - Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
    - Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
    - Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
- Largest County Turnout : Denver
- The Candidate results were:
    - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes
    - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes
    - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes
- The winner of the election was:
    - Diana Degette who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 of votes


## Election-Audit Summary
This script allowed us to find all of the above data and can be used in the future for other elections as well with just a few modifications. To use this script for other elections, we could modify the county variables/lists/dictionaries/statements to be for regions, cities, states, or other areas depending on the type of election going on. We could also modify the source file we are using to pull data from other election results. We may have to use different references if the lay out of the file is different, but the idea is still the same.
